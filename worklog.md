# Worklog — Autonomous Research & Self-Learning System

Project: Multi-agent orchestration research system with glassmorphic 3D frontend.
Single user-visible route: `/`. Backend orchestration via WebSocket mini-service on port 3003.

## Architecture Overview
- **Frontend (Next.js, route `/`)**: Glassmorphic 3D hero (React Three Fiber), research input, real-time agent workflow node graph (reactflow), streaming log, actor-critic loop viz, plugin registry, sticky footer.
- **Mini-service (`mini-services/research-orchestrator`, port 3003)**: socket.io server running the multi-agent orchestration (Plan → Discovery → Synthesis → Generation → Critique loop) using z-ai-web-dev-sdk (LLM + web_search). Streams events to client. Maintains in-memory task state + plugin registry.
- **Event contract** (socket.io, path `/`, XTransformPort=3003):
  - client → server: `research:start`, `plugins:request`, `history:request`
  - server → client: `research:phase`, `research:thought`, `research:source`, `research:critique`, `research:iteration`, `research:plugin`, `research:final`, `research:error`, `plugins:list`, `history:list`, `connect`

Task ID: 0
Agent: orchestrator (main)
Task: Bootstrap project plan, worklog, and dependency setup.

Work Log:
- Explored existing Next.js 16 scaffold; confirmed shadcn/ui, framer-motion, prisma (sqlite), z-ai-web-dev-sdk present.
- Loaded LLM and web-search skills (z-ai-web-dev-sdk backend usage confirmed).
- Reviewed websocket example (socket.io path `/`, XTransformPort query param pattern).
- Defined architecture and socket event contract above.

Stage Summary:
- Plan locked in. Next: install 3D/visualization deps, create mini-service, update prisma schema, then build frontend + backend.

Task ID: 1
Agent: orchestrator (main)
Task: Build the full multi-agent research system end-to-end (backend mini-service + glassmorphic 3D frontend) and self-verify with Agent Browser.

Work Log:
- Installed deps: three, @react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei, reactflow, socket.io-client (+ @types/three) in main project; socket.io + z-ai-web-dev-sdk in mini-service.
- Updated prisma schema (ResearchTask, CustomPlugin models) + db:push.
- Built mini-service `mini-services/research-orchestrator/index.ts` (port 3003): socket.io server running Plan→Discovery→Synthesis→Critic→Evolution→Final orchestration with z-ai-web-dev-sdk (LLM chat.completions + functions.invoke('web_search')). Actor-Critic loop capped at 3 iterations. Retry+graceful degradation on LLM calls. 3 seed plugins pre-loaded. Streams events: research:phase/thought/source/iteration/critique/plugin/final/error + plugins:list + history:list.
- Built frontend (route `/`): 
  - globals.css: glassmorphic utilities (.glass, .glass-strong, .glass-hover), aurora blobs, grid overlay, custom scrollbar, pulse-ring, shimmer, gradient text, reactflow overrides, markdown prose.
  - layout.tsx: forced dark mode, NEXUS metadata.
  - orchestrator-store.ts: zustand store + socket.io client (io('/?XTransformPort=3003')) wiring all events.
  - Scene3D.tsx: R3F floating distorted glass icosahedrons + particle field + mouse parallax.
  - Background.tsx: fixed 3D + aurora blobs + grid + vignette.
  - WorkflowGraph.tsx: reactflow live execution DAG (Coordinator→subqueries→sources→Synthesis↔Critic→Evolution→Final) with glowing glass nodes.
  - StreamingLog.tsx, CriticLoop.tsx, PluginRegistry.tsx (code viewer), FinalReport.tsx (react-markdown + sources), HistoryPanel.tsx, ResearchConsole.tsx (3D tilt input), Header.tsx, Footer.tsx (sticky), GlassCard.tsx.
  - page.tsx: hero + pipeline strip + live workspace (graph+stream) + critic+plugins + final report + architecture features + history.
- Fixed a critical bug: in GlassCard.tsx the rest param was named `...motion`, shadowing the framer-motion `motion` import and causing "Element type is invalid" 500. Renamed to `...rest`.
- Agent Browser self-verification (via gateway port 81 so XTransformPort routing works):
  - Page renders cleanly, no console/runtime errors.
  - Socket connects ("orchestrator live"), 3 seed plugins load.
  - Launched a real research goal (small modular reactors). Verified live: Coordinator decomposed into 3 sub-queries, Discovery found 12 sources, Synthesis drafted, Critic flagged real flaws (missing citations, unsupported claims) across 3 iterations, Evolution generated & cached a new `smr_research_analyzer` Python plugin (registry 3→4 tools), Final report delivered in 87.4s with evidence list. Run archived with rerun option.
  - Verified mobile (390x844) + desktop layouts; sticky footer intact.

Stage Summary:
- System fully functional end-to-end through the gateway. Multi-agent orchestration, actor-critic self-critique, and self-teaching plugin evolution all verified working with a real LLM-driven run. No lint errors, no runtime errors. Dev server (3000) + orchestrator mini-service (3003) both running.

Task ID: 2
Agent: orchestrator (main)
Task: Implement Phase 2 blueprint refinements — (1) agents/+tools/ directory architecture, (2) per-phase ambient glow on active panels, (3) model fallback pipeline so 402/credit exhaustion never freezes a run.

Work Log:
- Refactored the single-file orchestrator into the blueprint's `backend/agents` + `backend/tools` layout:
  - agents/{planner,researcher,synthesizer,critic,evolution}.ts
  - tools/{sdk,llm,web_search}.ts
  - shared types.ts + util.ts
  - index.ts is now a thin server + orchestration loop calling the agents.
- tools/llm.ts implements the model fallback pipeline (Step 4): `llm()` (primary, retry+backoff) → `llmWithFallback()` returns degraded on exhaustion → `degradedSynthesis()` compiles a cited Markdown report from raw web snippets with NO llm. Mirrors the litellm model_pipeline concept, adapted to z-ai-web-dev-sdk (no Ollama available → degraded no-LLM path is the fallback).
- Orchestrator wires degraded mode through every phase: planner fail → single-query discovery (search still runs); synthesis fail → degraded snippet compilation + skip critic loop; critic fail → accept draft; evolution fail → skip plugin. Emits a new `research:routing` event ({mode,reason}) so the UI can react. Final payload now carries `routingMode` + `degraded`.
- Frontend Step 3 glow: added `.agent-glow` + per-phase `drop-shadow` classes (planning=emerald, discovery=teal, synthesis=amber, critique=rose, generation=orange, final=emerald) with a 2.6s breathe pulse + 0.6s filter transition in globals.css. New `usePhaseGlow(roles)` hook applies the active phase's glow to the matching panel: ResearchConsole(planning), Execution Graph(all active phases), StreamingLog(discovery), CriticLoop(critique), PluginRegistry(generation), FinalReport(synthesis/final).
- UI routing indicators: ResearchConsole now shows a "primary"/"fallback" Cpu chip + amber "degraded" badge; FinalReport shows a "degraded"/"delivered" badge and an amber degraded-mode banner with the failure reason; store tracks routingMode/routingReason and logs Router thoughts.
- Fixed a bootstrap bug: tools/sdk.ts initially failed to write (dir missing) → "Cannot find module './sdk'"; recreated the file and cleanly restarted the mini-service.
- Agent Browser self-verification (via gateway :81):
  - Normal run (perovskite solar cells): primary routing held, Coordinator→3 branches→12 sources→3 critique iterations→plugin `perovskite_research_fetcher` spawned (registry 3→4)→DELIVERED in 51.8s. No errors.
  - Degraded run (forced 402 via env-gated hook): Router emitted "Model routing → degraded", planner fell back to single-query discovery, search found 4 sources, synthesis compiled degraded draft, plugin skipped gracefully, run COMPLETED in 3.8s (no freeze) with degraded badge + banner. Reverted the hook afterward.
  - Final reload: lint clean, page loads, socket "orchestrator live", primary routing, 3 seed plugins, no console/runtime errors.

Stage Summary:
- Phase 2 blueprint fully implemented & verified. The orchestrator now matches the agents/+tools/ architecture, active panels pulse with phase-colored ambient glow, and the system never freezes on LLM exhaustion — it degrades to a sourced no-LLM report and surfaces the mode in the UI. Both primary and degraded paths browser-verified end-to-end.

Task ID: 3
Agent: orchestrator (main)
Task: Add mode-aware synthesis — when the goal is a research/conclusion question, agents must follow the strict independent-research-analyst methodology (primary data only, strip narrative, show logic, definitive conclusion). When the goal is a blueprint/design request, switch to best-ideas actionable design using latest research.

Work Log:
- Added TaskType ('research'|'blueprint') to backend types + TaskState, and to frontend store + HistoryItem + finalMeta.
- agents/planner.ts: Coordinator now classifies the goal AND decomposes it in ONE LLM call (token-efficient — no extra round-trip). Returns { subqueries, taskType }. Emits a new `research:taskType` event.
- agents/synthesizer.ts: two mode-aware system prompts:
  - research → the user's exact independent-analyst rules (Primary Data Only / Strip the Narrative / Show Your Logic / Form an Independent Conclusion, no "some say X others say Y" hedging).
  - blueprint → senior-architect best-ideas prompt (core objectives, architecture/step-by-step, key tech with rationale preferring newest approaches, concrete next actions).
- agents/critic.ts: two mode-aware criteria sets:
  - research → flags hedging, narrative/wording adoption, non-primary data (opinion/PR/consensus), missing logic chain, unsupported claims.
  - blueprint → flags vague/non-actionable objectives, missing architecture, outdated tech when sources show better, missing concrete next actions.
- Orchestrator index.ts: passes taskType to synthesize() + critique() in both the normal loop and the degraded branch; emits research:taskType + a Coordinator thought announcing the classification; includes taskType in research:final + history:list payloads.
- Frontend store: handles research:taskType event; tracks taskType; resets it on start/reset; reads it from final payload.
- UI:
  - ResearchConsole: new task-type badge (Microscope/research=teal vs Wrench/blueprint=orange) with tooltip describing the active methodology; updated examples to include both a research ("Is LFP objectively safer than NMC?") and a blueprint ("Design a blueprint for a decentralized AI inference network") prompt.
  - FinalReport: title/subtitle/icon/accent all switch by mode ("Independent Research Analysis" teal vs "Actionable Blueprint Output" orange). New teal methodology banner appears ONLY in non-degraded research mode explaining the analyst rules + that the Critic verified them. Degraded banner unchanged.
- Agent Browser self-verification (via gateway :81):
  - Research query "Is LFP objectively safer than NMC for grid storage?": Coordinator emitted "Classified as a RESEARCH goal"; research badge shown; report title = "Independent Research Analysis"; Critic flagged "Reliance on non-primary data - Reddit discussions are not primary scientific data" + "Unsupported claims" + "needs step-by-step reasoning" (exactly the analyst criteria); methodology banner displayed; DELIVERED in 80.5s, 2 iterations.
  - Blueprint query "Design a blueprint for a decentralized AI inference network": Coordinator emitted "Classified as a BLUEPRINT goal"; blueprint badge shown (orange); report title = "Actionable Blueprint Output"; NO methodology banner (correct — banner is research-only); 3 critique iterations enforcing blueprint criteria (vague/outdated/missing-architecture); DELIVERED in 56.5s.
  - No console/runtime errors in either run. Lint clean.

Stage Summary:
- The engine now auto-detects research vs blueprint goals and applies the correct methodology end-to-end. Research queries get the strict independent-analyst treatment (primary data, no narrative adoption, logic shown, definitive verdict) with a Critic that specifically catches hedging and non-primary sources; blueprint queries get a best-ideas actionable design with a Critic that catches vagueness and outdated approaches. Both modes browser-verified.
